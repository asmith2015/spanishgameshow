1) Basic Story Outline that answers the following:

• Who is the player? The player is a Spanish student from St. Andrew’s Priory.

• Where is the player? The player is at a Spanish game show testing their knowledge.

• What does the player want/what is her ultimate goal? The player’s ultimate goal is to get through the game show without taking the wrong key, but to also grasp somewhat of an understanding of Spanish grammar and vocabulary.

• What are the obstacles that must be overcome to achieve the ultimate goal? The player must overcome the obstacle of choosing the right key. 

• Describe the obstacles and what the player needs to do to overcome them. If the player chooses the wrong key they lose. The undo is disabled in the game. The player needs to examine the door and think about the question being asked.

• How does the IF end? What action triggers the end of story? The IF ends by the player opening up the chest in the Final Showcase with correct key. 

• What other endings are there? If the player takes the wrong key the game ends. Undo is disabled.

2) Responses to the following questions:

• Other than to complete an assignment, what did you want to accomplish by creating this IF? I wanted people taking Spanish, specifically the lower levels, to grasp somewhat of an understanding of Spanish grammar and vocabulary.

• How well does this IF accomplish what you set out to do? I think it does it pretty well because it includes many aspects of Spanish grammar and even includes irregular conjugations.

• Discuss in detail a time when you got stuck, and how you got unstuck. I got stuck with my doors, as always. I always mess up on my doors. I somehow had messed up the directions and created doors that led nowhere. I got unstuck because Ms. Kiang helped guide me through my map and such.

• Tell of a time a classmate helped you and of a time you were able to help a classmate. I forgot how to make people and how to talk to them, so Melissa helped me. I helped Lindsay with how to make bold text in the IF.

• Discuss the gameplay mechanics in your IF and how they improve the user's experience. Think of the changes you made in your story ideas and/or puzzles during the course of creating this IF.
Some of the game play mechanics that I used in my game were a Spanish extension, talking, and no undo. They improved the user’s experience because it forces them to type response in Spanish and really try to understand what the game is saying. Also, it gives them an interactive experience.

3) Beta testing

• Whose IF did you test?  What valuable feedback were you able to give them? I played Melissa’s IF. I gave her the feedback to put more descriptions.

• Who beta tested your IF? How did their feedback help you with your own IF? Melissa tried to beta test my game and Lindsay fully beta tested it. From her feedback I gave more hints and tried to make the directions clearer. Also, I bolded some of the information in the IF.

4) Inform

• Consider your whole experience with Inform.

~ What do you like about programming with Inform? I like that inform is just words and no numbers.

~ What was challenging about programming with Inform? Inform is challenging because you have to say stuff a certain way or the computer won’t understand you.

~ What resources were the most useful for the questions you had about Inform? Ms. Kiang, classmates, and Ms. Kiang’s websites were the most useful resources for Inform.

~ What advice would you give to someone just starting to learn Inform? Don’t give up and try to think really hard about the problem before asking for help.

~ What are you most proud of regarding your programming abilities and projects, so far? I’m most proud that I was actually able to make a game. However, I’m most proud of my Spanish game because I was able to make a game in another language. This game even challenges me.
